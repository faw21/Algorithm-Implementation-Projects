CONTENTS

This project implements MST-Walk algorithm to find an approximate solution to
Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem. The following files should be present:

  City.java
  Edge.java
  EuclideanTSP.java
  Map.java
  DemonstrateEuclideanTSP.java

USAGE

Compile and run:

  javac DemonstrateEuclideanTSP.java
  java DemonstrateEuclideanTSP NUMBER_OF_CITIES

This will generate random NUMBER_OF_CITIES cities, find and display
the MST, then find and display the MST-Walk tour.
