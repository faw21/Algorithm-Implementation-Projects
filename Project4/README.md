### INTRODUCTION ###

This algorithm finds and gives the longest common subsequence of two strings. For instance, an LCS of the strings `haedlelfog` and `abchxeylzloabc` is the string `hello`. Note that the characters of the LCS do not need to be contiguous in either of the original strings. Also, there may be multiple LCS's.

### INSTALLATION ###

The following files should be present:
```	
	TestLCS.java
	LCS.java
	README.md
```	

### USAGE ###

Simply compile and run the TestLCS.java, and it will show the result.

### PROBLEMS ###

No known problems.
