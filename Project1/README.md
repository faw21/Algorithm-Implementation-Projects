### INTRODUCTION ###

The Cloth-cutting Problem is a similar problem with the knapsack problem: Given a rectangular cloth with dimension X(width) by Y(height), one should cut this cloth into pieces to make goods among n different kinds that could be sold at different price. Also, different goods require different area of cloth (xi by yi). This program is written to find out a best way to cut the given cloth in order to achieve highest value.

### INSTALLATION ###

The following files should be present:
	
	TestClothCutter.java
	ClothCutter.java
	Pattern.java
	Cloth.java
	Cut.java
	Garment,java
	README.md
	

### USAGE ###

Simply compile and run the TestClothCutter.java, and it will show the visual solution of the cloth-cutting problem.

The variable of:
```
width
height
```
could be changed to modify the dimension of the cloth.

You can also add patterns under the main method using the format below:
	
`patterns.add(new Pattern(int width, int height, int value, String name));`

or delete the patterns existed.

### PROBLEMS ###

No known problems.
