### INTRODUCTION ###

An Anagram is a permutation of the letters of a word or phrase. For instance, 'agstemecrasese' can be unscrambled (with the addition of spaces) to yield 'a secret message' (and many other phrases as well).

This project unscrambles anagrams into words of the dictionary.

INSTALLATION

The following files should be present:
	
	AnagramDecoder.java
	dictionary.txt
	

USAGE

Simply compile and run the TestClothCutter.java, and it will show the visual solution of the cloth-cutting problem.
The variable of:
	
	width
	height
could be changed to modify the dimension of the cloth.
You can also add patterns under the main method using the format below:
	
	patterns.add(new Pattern(int width, int height, int value, String name));

or delete the patterns existed.

PROBLEMS

No known problems.
