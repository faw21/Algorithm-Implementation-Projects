### INTRODUCTION ###

An Anagram is a permutation of the letters of a word or phrase. For instance, `agstemecrasese` can be unscrambled (with the addition of spaces) to yield `a secret message` (and many other phrases as well).

This project unscrambles anagrams into words of the dictionary.

### INSTALLATION ###

The following files should be present:
```
AnagramDecoder.java
dictionary.txt
```
	
### USAGE ###

Compile and run:
```
javac AnagramDecoder.java
java AnagramDecoder DICTIONARY ANAGRAM
```
For example, 
```
java AnagramDecoder dictionary.txt gplesetnso
```
will print `lets go pens` along with several other ways to unscramble the anagram. 
### PROBLEMS ###

No known problems.
